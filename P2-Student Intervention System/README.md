## Training and Evaluating Models  
I choose the following three supervised learning models for this dataset  
1. Support Vector Machines  
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes  
3. Some random algorithm 

Let's go over them one by one

### Support Vector Machines
**Applications of SVM**

 Support Vector Machine (SVM) is primarily a classier method that performs classification tasks by constructing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that separates cases of different class labels.SVM supports both regression and classification tasks and can handle multiple continuous and categorical variables. As we saw in the same project, the categorical variables are turned into boolean variables by creating some dummy columns.
 
 SVMs can be used to perform both class
